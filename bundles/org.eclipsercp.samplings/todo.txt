- method for creating projects from directories directly from the samples plug-in. The problem
here is how to explain to people how to edit the projects inside the samples plug-in.
- option to copy back to source when debugging to edit the code. Dev mode option.
- resource listener to reset decorators when projects are manually deleted.
- import should include more context to tell if the loaded samples are from the same samples group
- enablement for the compare and import actions.
- junits???
