The Samples Manager is a tool to help you manage the code for each sample of the 
Equinox OSGi book. The manager shows samples for all chapters and parts of the book that have associated projects. Select a sample and 
click <b>Import</b> to load all related projects into the workspace. The Samples Manager also supports comparing the current workspace to the set of resources for a sample. 
For example, if your workspace contains the projects for Chapter 5, you can see all the changes 
required for Chapter 6 by selecting Chapter 6 in the list and clicking <b>Compare</b>. This gives you 
a standard Eclipse compare editor.  Using the compare editor you can copy the Chapter 6 changes 
into the workspace.
